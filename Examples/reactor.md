# Reactor analysis

We would like to understand the mixing characteristics of the various reactors that we are designing and building. The parameters that describe the reactors are the number of CMFRs in series or the Peclet number and the ratio of the hydraulic residence time to the tracer residence time. We will use scipy.optimize curve_fit to minimize the error between our two reactor models (CMFR in series and advection/dispersion) and the tracer data that we collect.

Figure 1. Plot of tracer response curve for a completely mixed flow reactor. The discrepancy is likely due to poor calibration of the photometer for low concentrations.

Figure 2. Plot of the tracer response curves for a reactor with one baffle. Although both CMFR in series and advection dispersion models fit the data remarkably well, the best fit is obtained by the advection dispersion model. It accurately predicts the lag between dye addition and arrival at the effluent of the reactor. The large difference between the residence time of the tracer and the hydraulic residence time suggests either a measurement error (reactor volume or flow rate) or significant short circuiting.
